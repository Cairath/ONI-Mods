  Drywall is rendered on top of all the ugly pipes for extra prettiness. Visual only - DOES NOT affect decor calculations.
  
 * **Flow Splitters** (FlowSplitters.dll)

  Adds a Liquid and Gas Flow Splitters, which have an input and two outputs. The splitter splits incoming gas/liquid into two packets of the same sizes and sends them to outputs. If one output gets clogged, the second output will receive more flow.

  Water sieve outputs water and dirt at their input temperature instead of at fixed 40C.

* **Piped Algae Terrarium** (PipedAlgaeTerrarium.dll)

* **Ranching Sensors** (RanchingSensors.dll)

  Three sensors, each sets to active or inactive when the number of creatures/eggs/creatures+eggs is above/below certain threshold.
  
* **Buildable props** (BuildableProps folder)

  Buildable stuff that is in Points of Interest. Currently available: mosaic tiles, steel ladder, chairs, wall clock, computer desk, couch, gravitas monument, table with chairs. Requires luxury research and higher-end materials to build (steel, plastic).  
  The tiles and steel ladder are fully functional, the other items are simply decorative.
