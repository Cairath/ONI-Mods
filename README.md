* **Conveyor Rail Filter** (ConveyorFilter.dll)

  Adds a new object - a filter for conveyor rails. Allows filtering one or multiple items and sends them to a second output line.  
   Note: the second output icon for filtered line does not display, but the filtered output cell is between input and output.
   
 * **Conveyor Rail Shutoff** (ConveyorShutoff.dll)
 
   Adds a new object - an automatable conveyor rail shutoff.
  
* **Take Medicine Threshold** (TakeMedicineBoosterThresholdMod__.dll)

  Sets the immunity at which dupes will start taking vitamins (immunity boosters) to not waste them at 99%. Number in the file is the threshold (eg. dupes will consume vitamins if they immunity drops to 80%)

* **Water Sieve Output** (WaterSieveFixedOutput.dll)

  Water sieve outputs water and dirt at their input temperature instead of at fixed 40C.

* **Piped Algae Terrarium** (PipedAlgaeTerrarium.dll)

  Adds (does not override the existing one) a new Algae Terrarium that functions like the basic one, except it has a piped polluted water output.

* **Critter Number Sensor** (CritterNumberSensor.dll)

  Sets to active or inactive when the number of creatures (both alive critters and their eggs) is above/below certain threshold.
