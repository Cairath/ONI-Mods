# Instructions

## Download
Mods are distributed via [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076768290/myworkshopfiles/?appid=457140) - subscribe/unsubscribe freely there.  
Since Steam has extreme issues with updating mods and often serves old files, please use [Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283). As a backup solution, you can download mods directly [here](https://static.toolsnotincluded.net/Mods.zip). Choosen mod folder has to be placed in `...Documents\Klei\Oxygen Not Included\mods\local`. Note: this zip file is not always up to date.

## Updates
Please make sure the mods you use are up to date and remove ones that aren't or have been deprecated - they are likely to crash the game. The game log will note which version has been loaded, all version numbers should start with `2022.10`, earlier versions are out of date.

Please note that github isn't updated often, the code is up mostly for educational purposes.
