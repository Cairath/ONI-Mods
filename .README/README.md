# Instructions
## Download
To use the mods you need to install ONI-ModLoader using instructions available [here](https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader#installation)

Compiled mod files are available for download in the [Mods folder](/Mods). You can download separate mods or the or alternatively the [entire zipped pack](https://github.com/Cairath/ONI-Mods/blob/master/Mods/%5ECompletePack.zip) at once.

## Installation
Unzip the downloaded mod archives, then place the mods (in their respective folders) inside the Mods folder (you need to create one manually) in the game root directory.
The directory tree should look like this:
* .../OxygenNotIncluded/
  * Mods/
    * SomeMod/
      * SomeMod.dll
    * AnotherMod/
      * AnotherMod.dll

## Updates
Please make sure you update mods and remove ones that are not up to date or archived - they are likely to crash the game.
