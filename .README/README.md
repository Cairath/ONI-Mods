# Instructions
## Download
Mods are distributed via [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076768290/myworkshopfiles/?appid=457140) - subscribe/unsubscribe freely there.  
Since Steam has extreme issues with updating mods and often serves old files, please use [Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283). As a backup solution, you can download mods directly [here](https://static.toolsnotincluded.net/Mods.zip). Choosen mod folder has to be placed in `...Documents\Klei\Oxygen Not Included\mods\local`. Note: this zip file is not always up to date.


## Updates
Please make sure the mods you use are up to date and remove ones that aren't or have been deprecated - they are likely to crash the game. The game log will note which version has been loaded, all version numbers should start with `2022.10`, earlier versions are out of date.

Please note that github isn't updated often, the code is up mostly for educational purposes. 


# [Tools Not Included](https://toolsnotincluded.net)
I am also an author of [Tools Not Included](https://toolsnotincluded.net) - a website with game tools, featuring a map database with over 100 000 maps uploaded. Check it out!

# Special thanks
To [@pardeike](https://github.com/pardeike), creator of [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), the library that made these mods possible.  
To all my Patrons on Patreon who support the development :)
