# Download & installation
To use the mods you need to install ONI-ModLoader using instructions available here: https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader#installation  
Compiled mod files are available for download in the [modfiles folder](/modfiles).  Once the Modloader is installed the mod files (*.dll) should be placed in the Mods folder (you need to create one manually) in the game root directory.  
Please make sure you update mods and remove ones that are not up to date or archived - they are likely to crash the game.
