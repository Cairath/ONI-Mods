# Instructions
## Download
To use the mods you need to install ONI-ModLoader using instructions available [here](https://github.com/javisar/ONI-Modloader#installation)
Compiled mod files are available for download in the [modfiles folder](/modfiles).    

## Installation
Once the Modloader is installed the mod files (*.dll) should be placed in the Mods folder (you need to create one manually) in the game root directory.

## Updates
Please make sure you update mods and remove ones that are not up to date or archived - they are likely to crash the game.
